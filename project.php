<h4>ABOUT NARUTO</h4>


<p class="para" >Naruto[a] is Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.
    It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage,
    the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.
    Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions,
    with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series;
    their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller  list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006.
    Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down.
    Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references  from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

    <h4>MANGA</h4>
    <p class="para">
        Naruto won the 16th Spanish Manga Barcelona award for the shonen category in 2010.[158] The manga won the Quill Award for graphic novel in 2006.[159][160] It was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine's 2009 Comics Awards.[161] In 2015, it was nominated for the 19th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.[162] Kishimoto Masashi was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards.[163] On TV Asahi's Manga S≈çsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150.000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, Naruto ranked seventh.[164]
The manga has 250 million copies in circulation worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. More than half of the total circulation were in Japan, with the remaining circulation from 46 countries and regions.[165][43] It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media's best-selling manga series;[166] their translation of the series appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller lists several times. It was included in the fiction section of Teacher Librarian's recommended list for 2008,[167] and School Library Journal described it as an essential manga for school libraries.[168] Volume 28 of the manga reached 17th place in the USA Today Booklist in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by Fruits Basket.[169] The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America.[170][171] In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40.[172] In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from Diamond Comic Distributors.[173] Responding to Naruto's success, Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008 that he was "very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them."[174]
Several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of IGN and Casey Brienza of Anime News Network felt that the result was a strong storyline,[175][176] but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for the same website, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot.[177] Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves[177] which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action.[177] Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as "dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling".[178] Briana Lawrence from Mania Entertainment describes the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel.[179] In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II's storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality.[175] The fights across the Part II received praise, most notably Naruto's and Sasuke's, resulting in major changes into their character arcs.[180][181][182] Meanwhile, the final battle between the two characters in the finale earned major praise for the choreography and art provided as well as how in depth the two's personalities were shown in the aftermath. Some writers criticized Kaguya being the least entertaining villain, making the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke more appealing as a result. The finale earned nearly perfect scores from both Anime News Network and Comic Book Bin, with the latter acclaiming the popularity of the title character.[183][184][185]
G≈ç It≈ç, a professor in the manga department of Tokyo Polytechnic University, compared the series' development to the manga of Dragon Ball, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well. G≈ç felt readers could empathize with the characters in Naruto via their inner monologue during battles.[186] The series also influenced the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World with director Edgar Wright saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a "killer move" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage.[187] When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work.[188] The fight scenes in general earned acclaim for how well written they are, something game developer CyberConnect2 took into account when developing the Naruto games.[189][190][191][192] Christel Hoolans, managing director director of Kana and Le Lombard, called Naruto the first long-running series after Dragon Ball to become a classic in France.[193]

        Sasuke Uchiha („ÅÜ„Å°„ÅØ„Çµ„Çπ„Ç±, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (ÊîØ„ÅÜÂΩ±, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).
